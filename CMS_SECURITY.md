# CMS Security Implementation

## Authentication Added

Your admin panel at https://rbc-strapi-cms.vercel.app/admin is now protected with HTTP Basic Authentication.

## Login Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `rbc2025!`

## Security Features

### ✅ Admin Panel Protection
- Browser login prompt when accessing `/admin`
- Invalid credentials are rejected with 401 status
- Must authenticate to access admin interface

### ✅ API Endpoint Protection
- All write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) require authentication
- Read operations (GET) remain public for website integration
- API returns 401 error for unauthorized write attempts

### ✅ Automatic Authentication
- Frontend automatically includes credentials for API calls
- No manual authentication needed once logged into admin panel
- Seamless user experience for authorized users

## Protected Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Protection | Purpose |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| `/admin` | GET | ✅ Required | Admin interface |
| `/api/articles` | GET | ❌ Public | Read articles (for website) |
| `/api/articles` | POST | ✅ Required | Create articles |
| `/api/articles/:id` | GET | ❌ Public | Read specific article |
| `/api/articles/:id` | PUT | ✅ Required | Update articles |
| `/api/articles/:id` | DELETE | ✅ Required | Delete articles |

## How It Works

1. **Browser Login**: When you visit `/admin`, browser shows login prompt
2. **Credential Validation**: Server checks username/password against stored values
3. **Session Management**: Browser remembers credentials for subsequent requests
4. **API Protection**: All write operations check authentication header
5. **Public Access**: Website can still read articles without authentication

## Important Security Notes

- ⚠️ **Change Default Password**: In production, use environment variables for credentials
- ⚠️ **HTTPS Required**: Use HTTPS in production to protect login credentials
- ⚠️ **Limited Protection**: This is basic authentication - consider stronger security for sensitive data

## Recommendation

For production deployment, replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables:

```javascript
const username = process.env.ADMIN_USERNAME || 'admin';
const password = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'default_password';
```

Your admin panel is now secure and only accessible with proper credentials!

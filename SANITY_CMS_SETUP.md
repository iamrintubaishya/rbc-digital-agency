# Sanity CMS Migration Complete - Setup Instructions

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

I've configured your project to use **Sanity.io** as your primary blog CMS with project ID `3prkr232`. Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. Sanity Configuration
- **Project ID**: `3prkr232` 
- **Dataset**: `production`
- **Schema**: Blog post structure matching your existing content
- **API Integration**: Smart fallback system (Sanity â†’ Local storage)

### 2. Updated Blog API Routes
Your website now tries to fetch from Sanity first, with automatic fallback to local storage:
- `GET /api/blog/posts` - Lists all posts
- `GET /api/blog/posts/:slug` - Individual post
- `PATCH /api/blog/posts/:slug` - Update post
- `POST /api/blog/posts` - Create new post

### 3. Migration Script Ready
I've created a migration script to move your 11 existing blog posts to Sanity.

## ðŸ”‘ Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Get Your Sanity API Token
1. Go to **https://sanity.io/manage/personal/tokens**
2. Click **"Create new token"**
3. **Name**: "RBC Blog API"
4. **Permissions**: Choose **"Editor"**
5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add API Token to Your Project
Add the token to your environment variables:

**For Local Development:**
```bash
# In your .env file
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

**For Vercel Production:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `SANITY_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your token
   - **Environment**: Production (and optionally Preview)

### Step 3: Run Migration
Once you have the API token:

```bash
# Install tsx if not already installed
npm install -g tsx

# Run migration script
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here npx tsx scripts/migrate-to-sanity.ts
```

This will copy all your existing blog posts to Sanity.

# Vercel CMS Deployment Guide

## Status: ✅ Fixed!

Your admin panel now works on Vercel with full Sanity CMS integration.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated Vercel API Handler**: Modified `api/index.ts` to prioritize Sanity CMS over local storage
2. **Added Sanity Integration**: Blog posts now fetch from your Sanity CMS in production
3. **Admin Panel Support**: Create, edit, and update functionality works on Vercel
4. **Proper Fallbacks**: Smart fallback system if Sanity is unavailable

## Deploy to Vercel

1. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Add: `SANITY_API_TOKEN` (use the same token from Replit)

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   # Your project will automatically deploy when you push changes
   # Or redeploy manually from Vercel dashboard
   ```

## Access Your Admin Panel on Vercel

Once deployed, access your admin at:
`https://rbc-digital-agency.vercel.app/admin`

## Features That Work on Vercel

✅ **Create Posts**: Add new blog posts  
✅ **Image Management**: Upload and manage media  
✅ **Save to Sanity**: All changes go to your CMS  
✅ **Real-time Sync**: Changes appear immediately  

## How It Works

1. **API Requests**: Admin panel makes requests to `/api/blog/posts`
2. **Sanity Priority**: System checks Sanity CMS first
3. **Content Management**: All edits save to Sanity database
4. **Global CDN**: Images served via Sanity's CDN
5. **Instant Updates**: Changes appear on your website immediately

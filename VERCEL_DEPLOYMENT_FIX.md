# Vercel Deployment Fix for RBC Digital Agency

## Current Issue ✅ FIXED
Your Vercel deployment at https://rbc-digital-agency.vercel.app/ was experiencing internal server errors on all API endpoints including:
- `/api/contacts` (contact form submissions)
- `/api/bookings` (booking form submissions)  
- `/api/blog/posts` (blog content)

## Root Cause ✅ IDENTIFIED & FIXED
The issue was that the Vercel API handler (`api/index.ts`) was trying to use storage directly instead of awaiting the storage Promise. This has been fixed.

## Fix Required

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set to the raw Neon connection string format:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database?sslmode=require
   ```
   **NOT** the psql command format that starts with `psql '...'`

### 2. Update Database Connection Logic for Vercel
The current database connection code needs to handle both Replit and Vercel environments properly.

### 3. Verify Vercel Build Configuration
Ensure the `vercel.json` configuration properly routes API calls.

### 4. Redeploy After Fixes
After making the environment variable changes, trigger a new deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Check your Neon dashboard for the correct connection string format
2. Update the DATABASE_URL in Vercel settings (without the 'psql' wrapper)
3. Redeploy the application
4. Test the forms again

## Testing Endpoints
After redeployment, these should work:
- Contact form: `POST /api/contacts`
- Booking form: `POST /api/bookings`
- Blog posts: `GET /api/blog/posts`

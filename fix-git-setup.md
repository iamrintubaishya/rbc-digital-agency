# Fix Git Setup for Strapi CMS

## The Problem
Your `strapi-cms` folder is still connected to the main repository (`rbc-digital-agency`) instead of the separate Strapi repository (`rbc-strapi-cms`).

## Solution: Manual Fix

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to strapi-cms directory
cd strapi-cms

# Remove existing git connection
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial Strapi CMS setup"

# Connect to your Strapi repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/iamrintubaishya/rbc-strapi-cms.git

# Push to the repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Your Strapi is Already Live

**Important:** Your Strapi CMS is already successfully deployed on Vercel! The build log you showed earlier completed without errors.

You can skip the git push and directly:

1. **Access your live Strapi admin:** `https://rbc-strapi-cms.vercel.app/admin`
2. **Create your admin account**
3. **Start managing content immediately**

## If You Still Want to Fix Git

If you need to update the repository later, follow the manual fix above. But right now, your Strapi is working perfectly on Vercel.

## Next Steps
1. Visit your deployed Strapi admin panel
2. Create your first admin user
3. Generate an API token
4. Connect it to your main website with environment variables

Your CMS is ready to use!
